            <h2>The Yurts at Pacific Trails</h2>

                <dt><strong>What is a yurt?</strong></dt>
                <dd>
                    Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground. Each yurt is fully
                    enclosed with canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a roof dome that can be opened.
                </dd>

                <dt><strong>How are the yurts furnished?</strong></dt>
                <dd>
                    Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down quilt and gas-fired stove.
                    Your luxury camping experience includes electricity and a sink with hot and cold
                    running water. Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.

                <dt><strong>What should I bring?</strong></dt>
                <dd>Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing
                    weather with light layers of clothing. It's also helpful to bring a flashlight and a
                    sense of adventure!</dd>
